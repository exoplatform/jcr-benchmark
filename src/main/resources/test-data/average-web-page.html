<h1 id="z">The Average Web Page</h1>

<div id="summary"><b>Summary</b>: We report on some preliminary results for the size and composition of the average web page.</div>

<p>What is the size of the average web page? How have web pages changed
over time? Few studies have been done recently until now (King 2003).
Ryan Levering, a PhD student at Binghamton University and Michal Cutler
from the same school set out to find how the average page is rendered
visually (Levering and Cutler 2006).</p>

<h2>WebSeer HTML Rendering Engine</h2>
<p>After surveying the field they wrote their own HTML rendering engine
they call WebSeer. Using parts of the Gecko code base Ryan and Michal
pieced together a web page rendering engine that parses and interprets
web pages on the server. Their report titled "The Portrait of a Common
HTML Web Page" shows the results from a psuedo-random crawl from the
DMOZ directory and associated pages. The paper focuses on web page area
usage, position, and frequency of use. All interesting and useful
metrics that we'll report on in a future article, but we wanted to find
out size-related data.</p>
<h3>Try Another Crawl for Size</h3>
<p>After discussing the issue with Ryan, he agreed to run another crawl
with his WebSeer tool to get size-related data. These are preliminary
results based a couple thousand page run using random pages from the
DMOZ directory as "seed" pages. Seed pages are crawled and pages they
linked to are also included in the analysis. The preliminary results
have the following caveats:</p>

<ol>
<li>CSS images not included</li>
<li>Framed pages were ignored, though internal frames were included</li>
<li>Only media objects using the embed tag are included</li>
<li>Only included unique objects in page sizes (as browsers cache objects with identical URLs)
</li><li>HTTP compression not turned on</li>
</ol>

<p>With these caveats in mind, here are the results for the average web page.</p>

<h4>Observations and Explanation</h4>
<p>Some observations and explanation of the results are in order here.
The results are for the uncompressed sizes, the 130K average web page
size does not included CSS images, and is the average for all pages
tested after their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been decompressed.
Some larger pages (CNN.com for example) skewed the results higher, most
pages were in the 70-80K range. However, some larger pages used HTTP
compression, which will push the average down a bit for our next run.</p>
<h5>Average HTML and Object Sizes</h5>
<p>HTML page size averaged 25K. For the images, GIFs were the smallest
on average, at 2.9K. GIFs are often uses as spacers and simple
flat-color icons so the results are no surprise. JPEGs averaged 11.9K,
nearly 4 times larger than the average GIF. JPEGs are typically used
for smooth-toned images like photographs and product shots. PNGs
averaged 14.5K, a bit larger than the average JPEG. With their superior
horizontal and vertical compression scheme, we've found PNG-8s to be
more efficient than GIFs in most cases.</p>
<h5>Average CSS and Script File Sizes</h5>
<p>For the external scripts and styles, the lower figure (11.2K for all
pages' external scripts for example) is the average for all pages
tested, whether they used scripts or not. For those pages that did use
external scripts, the scripts averaged 37.5K uncompressed in total. The
average total external CSS (for pages that used external CSS files) was
28.7K uncompressed.</p> 
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although these are preliminary results, the data gives us an idea of
the size and composition of the average web page. Without compression
and CSS images, the average web page is about 130K in size, with a 25K
HTML file, small GIFs and larger JPEGs, PNGs, and SWF files when used.
For those pages that use them external scripts averaged in total 37.5K
and external style sheets averaged in total 28.7K per page. The HTML
figures are in line with the home page trend I reported on in <i>Speed Up Your Site</i>
where the average home page HTML file size grew from 8,297 to 28,290
bytes from 1996 to 2002. However as web pages become more complex, each
individual component adds size and HTTP requests to the total page
payload.</p>
